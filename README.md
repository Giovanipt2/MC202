# MC202 - Data Structures

This repository contains all the programming assignments developed during the **MC202 - Data Structures** course at Unicamp. The course emphasizes understanding the C programming language (using the C99 standard), dynamic memory management, and the implementation and application of fundamental data structures.

## Topics Covered

- **C Programming Essentials**: Pointers, structs, memory allocation and deallocation  
- **Linear Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues  
- **Hashing and Hash Tables**: Collision resolution strategies and efficiency  
- **Trees and Heaps**: Binary trees, heaps, and priority queues  
- **Graphs**: Representation and traversal algorithms  
- **Problem Solving**: Applying data structures to practical algorithmic problems  

Each activity includes C source files, test cases, and documentation to aid learning and serve as future reference.
